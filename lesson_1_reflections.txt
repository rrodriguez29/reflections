How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
 You choose when to revert back and when to keep going

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 You might forget to commit or you might choose inefficient times to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like GIT, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like google docs, treat each file separately?
 because code can be spread out into multiple files that work together.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 It would be more easier to go back and fix your mistakes.

How Do you want to use git?
