When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are working with other people who use a different computer than you.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You might pull code that is not yet ready to be introduced with your current local directory.
